    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pasta is a set of foods prepared with a dough whose basic ingredient is semolina, mixed with water, and to which salt, egg or other ingredients can be added, forming a product that is generally cooked in boiling water.
      In the East, buckwheat or rice flour is common, while most Western recipes follow the Italian tradition, therefore they use durum wheat flour.
