  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Making our own easy homemade pizza recipe is a much simpler process than we think, we just need to know the necessary pizza ingredients and the process to follow to integrate them.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Yeast</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Before starting with the easy homemade pizza recipe, it is essential to make a small clarification about the flour.</li>
    <li>Mix the warm water with the fresh yeast in a container. To make a homemade pizza dough you can easily use this type of yeast or make a pizza dough with dry yeast, both are valid. If you prefer dry, you should mix it with flour and if, on the other hand, you prefer fresh, it is essential to mix it with warm water. Fresh yeast is that which is sold in blocks and must be kept in the refrigerator.
    </li>
    <li>When you have mixed the yeast with the water, add the two tablespoons of oil. Mix well so that all the ingredients for the pizza are integrated.
    </li>
    <li>Before the preparation cools, add the strong flour and salt to a large bowl, arrange them in the shape of a volcano. Pour the previous mixture into the center.
    </li>
    <li>Now is when you have to start kneading well until you notice that the homemade pizza dough stops sticking to your hands and you can handle it without problems.
    </li>
    <li>When you have the spongy pizza dough ready, you should shape it into a long tube and cut it into 4 partitions. Then, make a ball with each partition and cover them with a clean, dry cloth. You should let them rest for 45 minutes. You will see that, little by little, they begin to rise until they double their volume. Each ball of dough will help you make a normal homemade pizza.
    </li>
    <li>After the corresponding time, sprinkle a little flour on a table to prepare the homemade pizza, take one of the balls and place it on it. Now you must extend it with your hands, stretching from the center to the sides, giving it a circular shape. If you have a rolling pin you can also use it to make the dough thinner. Once stretched, you can now add the homemade pizza sauce and the pizza toppings of your choice.
    </li>
    <li>Once you have chosen the ingredients and have your finished homemade pizza dough, you must preheat the oven to maximum temperature for about 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>After time, add the homemade pizza preparation and bake it for approximately 10 minutes. You will have to keep an eye on it because the final time will vary depending on the type of oven and its intensity.
    </li>
