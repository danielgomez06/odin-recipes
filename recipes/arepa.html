    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Arepas are a traditional food in some Latin American countries, where corn is a primary ingredient in the basic diet. This dough, made from corn flour, is usually cooked on a large griddle and is usually prepared to cook batches of more than one arepa.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cornmeal</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
      <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pour the water into a bowl, add the teaspoon of salt and dissolve it. Add the pre-cooked corn flour little by little. Once you have added it all, knead until you form a homogeneous dough.</li>
      <li>Keep kneading until it is completely integrated. Let it rest for about 5 minutes and resume kneading. If, after letting it rest, the dough is very liquid or very dry, add more flour or water respectively.</li>
      <li>Form medium balls with the dough, with this recipe you will make about 8 arepas. Begin to flatten them with your palms to make the traditional arepa shape. They should be at least 1 centimeter thick.</li>
      <li>Place a teaspoon of oil on a griddle and spread it over the entire surface with the help of kitchen paper. Heat and grill the arepas. Cook over low heat until you see that they have hardened on one side. Then, turn them over and let them brown on the other side.</li>
      <li>Make a cut on one side of the arepas and cut along the entire circumference. Open them and fill them with cheese and butter.</li>
    </ol>
